> Discord.js v13 pagination with buttons

## What's this project about?

Even before djs v13 was released, many discord opensource bots (which are written in nodejs) started to use buttons,
To help them and to make one for **Welcome-Bot**, we made this package!

## How to get started?

First install using npm:

```
npm install djs-pagination-buttons --save
```

Then go ahead you can use a [example we have made for you!](https://github.com/Welcome-Bot/discord-pagination/blob/main/example/bot.js)

Read the [docs](https://welcome-bot.github.io/discord-pagination/classes/Pagination.html) if you have any issues, you may also join the Welcome-Bot support server for queries!
